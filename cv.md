## Briefly About Myself:
I am an architect by specialization. Worked in this field for 4 years. Therefore, I have a lot of experience in working with the team, contractors, as well as with customers and their representatives.
I take part in solving issues about making changes to projects, finding new methods of rational solution to issues (with the help of software, programs) and helping colleagues in mastering these programs and software.
I'm always learning something new, in situations where obstacles arise at work, I don't stand still, I start looking for tutorials, video guides, other opinions.
I have always been interested in this field, curious about how it works from a technical point of view, as an architect I know how important it is to adapt to new technologies, the ability of software to optimize a routine process, provide greater opportunities for automated design, and also enable engineers to follow processes more intuitively /stages of design through the site/web application.
Therefore, for me, the IT field is the key to innovation in the fields of architecture and construction.
These are the reasons that motivate and encourage me to study and later work in IT, which will give me the opportunity to maximize my potential.
